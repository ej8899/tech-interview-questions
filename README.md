# Interview Questions & Red Flags ‚Äì Real Insights from a Hiring Perspective

Welcome! This public repository contains real-world interview questions, follow-up prompts, and notes gathered from my direct involvement in hiring for IT, cybersecurity, cloud, and technical roles.

## üîç About This Repo

I work hands-on in resume evaluation and technical hiring for a variety of tech positions, including support, cloud admin, cybersecurity, and solo IT roles in lean or startup environments.

Here‚Äôs how my workflow typically looks:

1. **Initial AI Screening:**  
   I provide the job description and upload the candidate‚Äôs resume to an AI tool. The AI generates:
   - A list of initial red flags  
   - A suggested set of interview questions  
   - A score or match level between the resume and the job description  

2. **Manual Deep Dive:**  
   I then review the resume myself, looking for authenticity and alignment. Specifically, I check:
   - Does the resume look like it was generated by AI just to match keywords?
   - Does the experience actually make sense given the claimed skillset?
   - Is the candidate likely qualified for a security-sensitive or privileged role?
   - Are the credentials and certifications real and current?
   - Does the resume line up with the person‚Äôs social media presence?
   - Are they even active in the community or industry conversations?
   - Is there evidence of actual project experience, or is it all buzzwords?

This blend of automation and real-world scrutiny helps me separate surface-level candidates from those who are genuinely prepared for technical work in modern IT environments.

My responsibilities also include:

- Creating interview questions that expose practical knowledge and depth
- Conduct technical interviews as necessary (if candidate passes to this stage)  
- Providing HR and leadership with clear feedback on candidate strengths and risks  
- Helping identify people who are ready to thrive in real-world, fast-paced tech settings  

## üéØ Why Make This Public?

Many job seekers never get honest feedback about why their resumes or interviews fall short ‚Äî especially for tech roles. This repo aims to provide:

- **Transparency:** Real examples of questions I ask, and the thought process behind them  
- **Preparation Help:** If you‚Äôre job hunting, use these questions to self-assess and prepare  
- **Industry Perspective:** See what hiring managers actually look for ‚Äî and what raises concern  

## üß† What You'll Find Here

- Markdown-formatted interview question sets for various scenarios  
- Role-specific follow-up questions that help probe depth of knowledge  
- Notes and commentary on resume red flags, outdated certs, or misrepresented skills  
- Occasional updates as I encounter new patterns or adapt for different role types

## üëã Who This Is For

- **Job seekers** who want an inside look at the interview table  
- **Junior tech professionals** preparing for admin, cloud, or security roles  
- **Career changers** aiming to better understand hiring expectations  
- **Fellow interviewers** who want to improve or diversify their own question sets
