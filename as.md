## 🚩 Red Flags in Resume + Targeted Interview Questions

### 1. **Experience Appears SMB-Focused, Not Enterprise-Level**
**Red Flag:** Most roles involve smaller environments (e.g., local medical clinic, SMB tech shop). No indication of managing large-scale, critical infrastructure.

**Interview Question:**
> Can you walk us through the largest IT environment you’ve personally managed?

**Follow-up Prompts:**
- How many endpoints or users were involved?
- What kind of uptime or availability SLAs were you responsible for?
- Did you manage multiple sites or datacenters?

---

### 2. **Overinflated Titles vs. Task Descriptions**
**Red Flag:** Position titles suggest seniority, but duties read more like Tier 2 support or junior admin tasks at most.

**Interview Question:**
> What were your core responsibilities day-to-day in your Systems Analyst role?

**Follow-up Prompts:**
- Were you responsible for designing any systems, or primarily supporting them?
- Who handled vendor relationships and infrastructure decisions?
- Did you write or approve any technical standards or policies?

### 3. **Breadth of Skills with Unclear Depth**
**Red Flag:** Resume lists many tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Oracle, CI/CD), but offers no concrete examples of real implementation or scale.

**Interview Question:**
> I noticed Kubernetes and Docker listed—can you describe a project where you used containerization in production?

**Follow-up Prompts:**
- What was your role in the setup?
- What challenges did you face during deployment?
- Did you monitor or scale the cluster?

---

### 4. **Light Security and Compliance Exposure**
**Red Flag:** Mentions “cybersecurity” and “incident response” but in vague, support-based terms. No leadership, audit ownership, or security architecture experience shown.

**Interview Question:**
> What specific security controls or compliance requirements have you implemented in past roles?

**Follow-up Prompts:**
- Have you been part of a PCI-DSS or SOC 2 compliance effort?
- What was your role during an internal security audit?
- How do you typically handle access control across systems?

---

### 5. **Certifications Don’t Match Senior Admin Level**
**Red Flag:** Holds A+, ITIL, and Azure Fundamentals—these are entry-level and don't match the seniority of the job applied for.

**Interview Question:**
> What’s your certification strategy going forward—are you pursuing advanced credentials like Azure Administrator or a CCNA?

**Follow-up Prompts:**
- How do you stay current with enterprise technologies?
- Have you led any projects requiring expert-level certification knowledge?

---

### 6. **No Demonstrated Experience with Required Systems  (ITS, Fiber, etc.)**
**Red Flag:** The job requires experience or quick learning ability for specialized systems. Resume contains no mention of anything comparable.

**Interview Question:**
> Have you worked with or supported infrastructure in industrial or transport-related environments?

**Follow-up Prompts:**
- How comfortable are you learning custom or niche platforms?
- Can you describe how you approach onboarding into unfamiliar systems?
