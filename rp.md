# Candidate Review: RP

## ðŸš© Red Flags

- **Resume formatting inconsistencies**: Typos, redundant phrasing, broken link to LinkedIn profile
- **Overuse of vague accomplishments**: Frequent terms used without data or examples.
- **Certification verification missing**: No verifiable links or Credly profile. Several credential names are non-standard or legacy.
- **Cloud & scripting claims are unproven**: Azure, AWS, PowerShell, and M365 listed with no project-based evidence.
- **Resume reads keyword-heavy**: Technologies listed span broad areas but lack measurable contribution, scope, or ownership.
- **Continuous learning not well demonstrated**: Despite certifications, there's no reference to labs, GitHub, community, or peer collaboration. 
- **LinkedIn**:  After manual search to find it - is vague and lacks meaningful posts.  Has a strangely high number of followers for next to zero content.
