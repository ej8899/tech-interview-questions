# Interview Questions For  
**Candidate: JS**


---

### Resume Red Flags:
- lack of attention to detail (duplicated items, skills, etc) 
- education is vague - one item but no program details or completion status
- keyword heavy but with no explanation of what has actually been done/accomplished (no accomplishments)
- "current" certifications, but no dates on them - with one cert being discontinued in 2021 (so clearly not 'current')
- no mention of m365, azure, aws, gcp, intune, etc. - everything listed is on-prem and/or legacy infrastructure.
 (our role demands cloud-native familiarity)
- no evidence of recent upskilling or any other proactive learning
- no talk of cybersecurity - aside from brief mention of SIEM - likely no management or leadership in cybersec. practices
