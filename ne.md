# 🚀 System Administrator Candidate Interview Questions – NF

Socials:
LinkedIn is 'the basics' - minimal (or old) conversations,  minimal engagement
Portfolio page - is just the 'basics' - profile photo and link to linked in and github - nothing more.
Github is empty.

## 1️⃣ Virtualization & VDI
- **“You led a VDI to cloud storage migration — what platform(s) were involved”** (we're hoping for azure or even aws for cloud solutions)
  - Follow-up: “Were you responsible for budgeting or ongoing cost monitoring after moving to the cloud?”

---

## 2️⃣ Office Network Build & Infrastructure
- **“You planned and built an enterprise office network — what specific gear did you use (firewalls, switches, WiFi controllers)?”**
  - Follow-up: “Was this primarily on-prem servers, a cloud-first setup, or hybrid?”
  - Follow-up: “What server OS platforms were deployed, and what roles did they run (fileshares, directory services, apps)?”

- **“Did you implement VLANs or traffic segmentation? How did you handle redundancy or failover?”**
- **"What size of network was this  (ie 10 users, 100 users, 1000 users)"**

## 3️⃣ Microsoft 365 / Azure / AWS
- **“Have you directly administered Microsoft 365 services — like Exchange mail flow, Teams policies, or SharePoint permissions?”**
  - Follow-up: “What security controls (MFA, conditional access) did you help implement?”

- **“What’s your experience managing Azure resources — VMs, storage accounts, virtual networking?”**
  - Follow-up: “Have you tied on-prem systems to Azure AD or set up hybrid identity?”

- **“Any hands-on experience with AWS — like EC2, S3, IAM policies, or deploying infrastructure with CloudFormation or similar?”**

## 4️⃣ Cybersecurity Depth Beyond Security+
- **“You have a Security+ — what real-world security tasks have you owned in production?”**
  - Follow-up: “For example — did you ever configure endpoint security policies, tighten firewall rules, or handle data classification?”

- **“Have you ever set up or tuned logging or alerting systems for security events? What tools did you use (syslog, cloud dashboards, SIEM like Sentinel or Splunk)?”**
  - Follow-up: “How did you decide what to alert on vs. what to just record?”

- **“Have you been directly involved in investigating or responding to a security incident?”**
  - Follow-up: “What did you do first, how did you contain it, and what changed afterward?”

- **“Have you ever developed, delivered or supported cybersecurity awareness training for non-technical staff?”**
  - Follow-up: “What did you emphasize, and how did you measure if it was effective?”

## 🧐 Weakness & Self-Assessment Questions

- **“Looking at this opportunity — it’s a pretty broad role, covering cloud platforms, networking, systems, security, and even vendor management. What’s one area you’d consider a relative weakness or where you’d want more support from us?”**

- **“Is there a technology in our environment you’ve had limited exposure to — maybe something like Microsoft 365, Azure, VMware, or database management — that you see as a growth area for yourself?”**

- **“What skill or technical area would you most want to sharpen in the next year, if you were to join us?”**
